          from the copyright holder to upload content to the Site. We comply
          with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and
          expeditiously remove content when properly notified, unless it
          reasonably appears to Us that the content does not infringe upon a
          valid copyright. You should educate yourself as to whether content
          does, in fact, infringe upon Your copyright, or whether, for instance,
          "fair use" under 17 U.S.C. §107 applies. If You are unsure whether the
          content You are reporting is infringing Your legal rights, You may
          wish to seek legal guidance. Keep in mind that submitting
